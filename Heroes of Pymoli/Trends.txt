Heroes of Pymoli

Written description of trends based off data:
1. Males make up the vast majority of players in Heroes of Pymoli. They also make up a vast majority of spending, which makes sense of course. 

2. Although males spend more over all, both females and others tend to spend more per purchase. 

3. The youngest players spend much less than the others. Likely due to lack of income. Players over the age of 20 outspent those under the age of 10 by around $1400 which is close to the entire sum of money spent on items at all.
